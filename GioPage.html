        <h4> Neutral </h4>
        <p>Essentially there's five main moves you'll be doing to both establish and counter space:.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>5K/Dash 5K</li>
            <li>2K/Dash 2K</li>
            <li>5H/Dash 5H</li>
            <li>2D/Dash 2D</li>
            <li>5P/Dash 5P</li>
        </ul>

        <h5>5K</h5>
        <p>6F startup mid, hurtbox near the standing foot, low recovery.
            We love this button it's good. Not too much to write home about specifically here that I won't cover in Dash 5K so.
        </p>

        <h5>Dash 5K</h5>
        <p>The holy relic of Gio neutral offense. With this covering a quarter of the screen, mid to close range is a great time as both players look at each other in high noon shootout fashion.</p>
        <p>Big thing here is that Dash 5K goes into 6P with a simple and humble 1F gap. Then in combo you can continue into 214K. This will allow you to OTG either 5K or c.S and then IAD j.H into a safejump. (5K>6P>214K>Dash>OTG c.S>9>IAD>j.H) </p>

        <h5>2K/Dash 2K</h5>
        <p>6F. Low</p>
        <p>The low kick to compliment 5K. This is our best fast low poke. Can be used round-start, in neutral, as an OTG for corner setups, etc. You want to confirm into 214K on normal hit or on CH try and go for a true 2D or use a K button again into 214K, potentially c.S as well can't remember if it gets into from CH 2K.</p>

        <h5>5H/Dash 5H</h5>
        <p>10f. Mid. Disjoint at the foot.</p>
        <p>Similar in hitbox concept to 5K but bigger and meatier and a fat disjoint to boot (ba dum tss). While not as whiffable as 5K it having a big ol’ disjoint makes it a great option to space out correctly. Leads to some of most damage, super confirm combos, and can be OS'd (214K1236K) so that you get 214K on block and 236K on hit. </p>

        <h5>2D/Dash 2D</h5>
        <p>17f. Low. Disjoint at (the dust) the end of your opponent’s hopes and dreams</p>
        <p>The move that has left Gio a pariah amongst her peers. The singular input that has us rivaling the dead sea in salt.</p>

        <h5>5P/Dash 5P</h5>
        <p>4F. Mid</p>
        <p>This button is really good for contesting closer spaces. Say for instance after 214K>Backdash. You can dash 5K but that might be too slow. Given the space you could go for dash 5P.</p>
